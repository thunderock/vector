# Project State: Vector

**Last updated:** 2026-05-10 (initial roadmap)

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Open the app, pick a Codespace, get a fast remote shell — no VS Code, no browser, no clunky `gh codespace ssh` plumbing. Local-terminal niceties are table-stakes; the differentiator is that a Codespaces / Dev-Tunnels session feels native, not bolted on.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 (Foundation & CI/DMG Pipeline) — not yet started. Ready for `/gsd-plan-phase 1`.

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 — Foundation & CI/DMG Pipeline
- **Plan:** 6 plans authored across 6 waves; ready for /gsd-execute-phase 1
- **Status:** phase 1 plans complete; awaiting execution
- **Progress:** `[..........]` 0/10 phases complete

## Phase Map

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- **Build fresh in Rust** (not fork ghostty/VS Code). Rationale: ghostty is Zig, VS Code is Electron; the Rust ecosystem (`alacritty_terminal`, `wgpu`, `tokio`, `russh`, `octocrab`) is mature enough to build cleanly without a fork.
- **Codespaces SSH v1 transport = subprocess `gh codespace ssh --stdio`.** Native `russh + tonic` over the port-16634 gRPC management API is v1.x. This eliminates the gnarliest protocol work from the v1 critical path while delivering the full user-facing feature.
- **Dev Tunnels Phase 8 is spike-gated.** Day 1 of Phase 8 is a 1–2 day spike that commits a decision document among (a) subprocess `code tunnel client`, (b) vendor `microsoft/dev-tunnels/rs/` at pinned SHA, (c) defer to v2. Defer-to-v2 is an acceptable outcome.
- **Persistence strategy = remote tmux, not Mosh.** `tmux new -A -s vector-{profile-id}` on connect; reconnect re-attaches. No custom remote agent, no predictive-echo state-sync protocol.
- **Defer signing/notarization to v2.** Unsigned Universal DMG with documented `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` bypass for v1.
- **TOML config only.** No Lua, no DSL. Hot-reload via `notify` (FSEvents).
- **`Domain` / `Pane` / `PtyTransport` seam** (WezTerm pattern) is the only boundary between terminal model and transport. Established in Phase 4; load-bearing for Phases 7, 8, 9.
- **`winit::EventLoop` on the main thread, `tokio` multi-thread runtime on background threads, `EventLoopProxy::send_event` as the only cross-thread signal.** Established in Phase 1 skeleton.

### Open Questions / Risk Register

- **Phase 8 Dev Tunnels** — highest known v1 risk. Spike outcome unknown until phase start.
- **Phase 7 native russh + gRPC path** (v1.x) — requires careful read of `cli/cli/internal/codespaces/grpc/client.go` and the `?internal=true&refresh=true` parameter behavior. Not a v1 blocker.
- **`russh 0.37` vs `0.60` version conflict** — only matters if Phase 8 spike picks "vendor SDK". Resolution: fork + bump, or accept ~3MB binary duplication.
- **Universal binary on CI** — `macos-14` runners are arm64-only, `macos-13` are x86_64. Matrix + `lipo` validated end-to-end in Phase 1, not assumed.
- **Basic IME (NSTextInputClient composition display) only in Phase 5.** Full IME with candidate window UI is v2 (TERM-V2-01).

### Research Artifacts

- `/home/colligo/vector/.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` — executive summary, 10-phase ordering converged on by all four research dimensions
- `/home/colligo/vector/.planning/research/STACK.md` — verified crate versions on crates.io as of 2026-05-10
- `/home/colligo/vector/.planning/research/FEATURES.md` — table-stakes vs differentiators, anti-feature list
- `/home/colligo/vector/.planning/research/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Domain/Pane/PtyTransport pattern, threading model
- `/home/colligo/vector/.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` — pitfalls ordered by damage potential; Dev Tunnels contingency plan

### Active Todos

- [ ] Execute Phase 1 (`/gsd-execute-phase 1`)

### Blockers

None.

## Session Continuity

**Next action when resuming:** Run `/gsd-execute-phase 1` to execute Phase 1 plans in wave order (1→2→3→4→5→6).

**Files to re-read on resume:**

1. `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure and success criteria
2. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — v1 requirements + traceability
3. `.planning/PROJECT.md` — core value, constraints, key decisions
4. `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` — research highlights
